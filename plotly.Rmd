```{r, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(plotly)
library(p8105.datasets)
```

use the Airbnb dataset
```{r}
data("nyc_airbnb")

nyc_airbnb = 
  nyc_airbnb |> 
  mutate(rating = review_scores_location / 2) |>
  select(
    neighbourhood_group, neighbourhood, rating, price, room_type, lat, long) |>
  filter(
    !is.na(rating), 
    neighbourhood_group == "Manhattan",
    room_type == "Entire home/apt",
    price %in% 100:500)
```


Let's make a scatter plot

```{r}
nyc_airbnb |>
  mutate(text_label = str_c("Price: $", price, "\nRating: ", rating)) |> 
  plot_ly(
    x = ~lat, y = ~long, 
    type = "scatter", mode = "markers",
    color = ~price, text = ~text_label, alpha = 0.5)
```

make a box plot

```{r}
nyc_airbnb |> 
  mutate(neighbourhood = fct_reorder(neighbourhood, price)) |> 
  plot_ly(x = ~neighbourhood, y = ~price, 
          color = ~neighbourhood, type = "box", colors = "viridis")
```

make a bar chat

```{r}
nyc_airbnb |> 
  count(neighbourhood) |> 
  mutate(neighbourhood = fct_reorder(neighbourhood, n)) |> 
  plot_ly(x = ~neighbourhood, y = ~n, 
          color = ~neighbourhood, type = "bar", colors = "viridis")
```

## ggplotly

```{r}
scatter_ggplot = 
  nyc_airbnb |>
  ggplot(aes(x = lat, y = long, color = price)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.25) +
  coord_cartesian()

ggplotly(scatter_ggplot)
```
