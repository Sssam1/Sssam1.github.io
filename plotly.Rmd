```{r, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(plotly)
library(p8105.datasets)
```

use the Airbnb dataset
```{r}
data("nyc_airbnb")

nyc_airbnb = 
  nyc_airbnb |> 
  mutate(rating = review_scores_location / 2) |>
  select(
    neighbourhood_group, neighbourhood, rating, price, room_type, lat, long) |>
  filter(
    !is.na(rating), 
    neighbourhood_group == "Manhattan",
    room_type == "Entire home/apt",
    price %in% 100:500)
```


Let's make scatter plots

```{r}
nyc_airbnb |>
  mutate(text_label = str_c("Price: $", price, "\nRating: ", rating)) |> 
  plot_ly(
    x = ~lat, y = ~long, 
    type = "scatter", mode = "markers",
    color = ~price, text = ~text_label, alpha = 0.5)
```
